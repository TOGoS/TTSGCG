*** DONE Make a small panel with "TTSGCG" on it and stick that in here to have an attractive README
*** TODO Publish as an NPM package
*** DONE Holes should be a shape instead of a separate task type
*** TODO Tool radius compensation

GRBL doesn't support G41/G42.  So I should emulate it.
Maybe with a 'Outline' shape that is defined in terms of another shape and whether to carve to the left or right.
- It's more than just shifting the path outwards, because there might be points where lines come together
  that you need to avoid.
- Maybe shift lines outwards and stop at any intersections and skip to the line that was intersected with.

*** TODO Carved character set
*** TODO Add option to generate SVG or draw to a <canvas> instead of G-code
