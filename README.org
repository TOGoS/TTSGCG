Generate simple G-code for milling stuff, in TypeScript.

I created this project because I wanted a simple command-line program for generating bits of G-code to cut lines and holes.
Existing programs for generating G-Code were hard for me to understand,
too specific to an OS other than the one I'm using, or too crash-prone.
